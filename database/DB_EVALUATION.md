# Database Technology Evaluation: InfluxDB vs. TimescaleDB\n\n## Background\nThis evaluation was conducted to select the primary database for the PLC Monitoring System. The key requirements are performance for time-series data, ease of use, and overall architectural simplicity, in line with the project goal of "enkelhet och administratörsvänlighet".\n\n## Comparison\n\n### InfluxDB\n- **Pros:**\n  - Excellent performance for high-volume data ingestion.\n  - Data model (measurements, tags, fields) is straightforward for simple metrics.\n- **Cons:**\n  - Uses proprietary query languages (InfluxQL/Flux), which adds a learning curve.\n  - Less flexible for complex queries and relational data. Would likely require a separate relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for storing configuration, alarm metadata, etc., leading to a more complex architecture.\n\n### TimescaleDB\n- **Pros:**\n  - Built as an extension on PostgreSQL, meaning it uses **standard SQL**. This is a major advantage for simplicity and talent accessibility.\n  - Allows for storing time-series and relational data in the same database. This dramatically simplifies the overall system architecture.\n  - Superior performance for complex queries, which will be essential for the AI/analysis component.\n  - Leverages the mature and robust PostgreSQL ecosystem.\n- **Cons:**\n  - May have slightly lower raw ingestion performance than InfluxDB in extreme-scale scenarios, but this is not considered a risk for this projects scope.\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**TimescaleDB is the recommended choice.**\n\nThe use of standard SQL and the ability to combine time-series and relational data in a single PostgreSQL instance directly supports the projects core goal of simplicity and ease of administration. This choice simplifies development, maintenance, and future expansion.
